# Blockchain Record Keeping System Overview

## Introduction

The Blockchain Record Keeping System is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to securely store, manage, and verify academic records on the blockchain. This system provides a tamper-proof and transparent way for educational institutions to issue academic credentials while giving students ownership and control over their records.

## Key Features

- **Secure Academic Record Storage**: Store academic records immutably on the blockchain with IPFS document storage
- **Verification System**: Instantly verify the authenticity of academic credentials
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for universities, administrators, and students
- **Record Sharing**: Students can selectively share their records with third parties
- **Custom Record Types**: Universities can create custom record types beyond standard ones

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Smart Contracts (Blockchain Backend)**:

   - Written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain
   - Handles data storage, access control, and business logic

2. **Web Application (Frontend)**:
   - Built with Next.js and React
   - Provides user interfaces for different user roles
   - Connects to the blockchain using ethers.js

## User Roles

1. **Super Admin**: Has ultimate control over the system, can add/remove admins and universities
2. **Admin**: Can manage universities and monitor system activity
3. **University**: Can issue academic records, create custom record types
4. **Student**: Can view their own records, share records with third parties
5. **Public**: Can verify records with a valid record ID

## Core Workflows

1. **Record Issuance**: Universities create and issue academic records to students
2. **Record Verification**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a record
3. **Record Sharing**: Students share their records with third parties
4. **University Management**: Admins register and manage universities

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Solidity Smart Contracts)
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata for document storage
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Web3 Integration**: ethers.js
- **Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication (MetaMask)
