# Project description

This project aims to build a decentralized academic record management system that leverages blockchain technology to securely store and verify student transcripts. The platform will allow universities to upload and manage academic records, while students can access their transcripts using unique credentials. This ensures that transcripts are tamper-proof and permanently preserved, protecting against data loss due to disasters like fire or floods. Students receive secure credentials to access their transcripts anytime and from anywhere, allowing them to view and download their academic records. They also maintain control over who can verify their transcripts, safeguarding their privacy.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
